# 05/28/23 Next App Router

Latest Nextjs version 13.4 deprecates `Page Router` in favor of `App Router`. It's not clear how to deal with those changes using `Relay`, there is an implementation on [relayjs examples](https://github.com/relayjs/relay-examples/tree/main/issue-tracker-next-v13) but it seems experimental
